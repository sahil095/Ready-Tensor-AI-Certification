# Ready Tensor Agentic AI Certification – Week 5

This repository contains lesson materials, code examples, reference scripts for Week 5 of the Agentic AI Developer Certification Program by Ready Tensor. This week marks the transition from traditional prompt pipelines to building agent-based AI systems using tools like LangGraph, LangChain, and LangSmith.

## What You'll Learn

- When to use workflows vs. agents
- How to build and run LangGraph projects
- How to trace and debug agentic flows with LangSmith
- How to integrate tools — both built-in and custom — into agent loops
- How to manage shared state and node-level behavior in LangGraph

## Lessons in This Repository

### 1. From Workflows to Agents: When Predictable Paths Aren’t Enough

Learn when and why to move beyond static LLM workflows toward more flexible, adaptive agentic systems.

### 2a. Building Agentic Systems at Scale: An Introduction to LangGraph
Get introduced to LangGraph — a framework for designing agentic flows as graphs of nodes, edges, and state — built for scalability and control.

### 2b. Your First LangGraph Project: Building a Joke Bot
Build a simple, non-LLM LangGraph joke bot to learn about graph structure, state objects, and routing logic.

### 2c. Agentic AI With LangGraph: Building a Writer–Critic Loop
Enhance your joke bot with LLMs and a writer–critic architecture. The agent generates, evaluates, and refines its output before sharing it with the user.

### 3. Inside the Mind of an Agent: Observability with LangSmith
Use LangSmith to trace every step of your agent's process — from LLM calls to tool usage — with full visibility into the graph’s state transitions.

### 4a. Beyond Conversation: Giving Your AI Agent the Power of Tools
Integrate built-in tools into your LangGraph workflow and design a Think–Act–Think loop. Let your agent retrieve real data and make decisions dynamically.

### 4b. Custom Tools, Custom Powers: Extending Your Agent’s Capabilities
Build your own tools from scratch and register them with your agent. Extend functionality in ways that suit your own domain or product use case.
